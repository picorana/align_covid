# Comparing outbreaks
Time series of countries affected by covid aligned by number of infected people rather than by date. Events are there to see if they kind of align or why they don't - e.g. how come South Korea has been declared CDC threat level 3 at about 800 infected, while france currently has >1200 and hasn't been declared level 3 yet? When did other countries start to close their schools?

It's interactive, move the slider on top to change the value used for the alignment.
